Y.A.N.C. - Yet Another Nixie Clock

This project is the software part of a larger project that include nixie tube clock with no physical controls but only "web" access.

The physical construction will be publish on Instructables (http://www.instructables.com/)

The project is two parts:

Physical part - Nixie Clock

- 4 nixie tubes (IN-14) display
- Raspberry PI Model A+ (256MB) for main controller
- Custom nixie driver circuit and audio ouput (PCB)
- MP3 Playback in alarm
- Sound activated display (extented life of tube)

Software part - Clock control and remote app

- Controler daemon for clock hardware control (Python)
- REST Server to interact with external world (look mom, no button!)
- IOS App to "talk" to the clock (Swift)

Simply put, this clock will look great, will sync itself on the Net and get it's alarms from my Google Calendar! :-)

More details coming...
